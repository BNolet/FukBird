# RLC - Reddit Live Chat 

This is a script made for [Reddit Live](https://www.reddit.com/live). 
RLC modifies the page to work as a real-time chat platform.

Note: This image is from dark mode on RLC v.3.8.1. We update the script very often and the layout may differ.

### Installation
This userscript requires TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey to function
* [TamperMonkey (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

Then, come hang out in the [RLC Dev Chat](https://www.reddit.com/live/wpytzw1guzg2)!
We'll assist you with any problems and listen to any feedback you might have.

### Major Features
